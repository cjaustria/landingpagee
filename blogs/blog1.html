      <p>
        <q>AI will not replace us, it will amplify us</q>, according to
        <cite>Pedro Domingos</cite>. This highlights an ongoing debate about whether
        <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> enhances human capability or weakens
        <em>independent thought</em> in modern society.
      </p>

      <p>
        Artificial intelligence tools are now embedded in global industries such as
        <strong>healthcare</strong>, <strong>finance</strong>, and <strong>education</strong>.
        In the <em>Philippine setting</em>, AI is increasingly present in digital banking,
        online learning platforms, and automated customer service systems, reshaping
        how people approach decision making.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Technology becomes a problem when convenience replaces critical engagement.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The Filipino concept of <strong>diskarte</strong> represents creativity and adaptability
        developed through experience. When AI provides instant answers, overreliance may
        reduce judgment and analytical reasoning.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Critical thinking</em> develops through engagement with complex problems. AI can serve
        as a support tool for research and organization, but excessive dependence on
        <span class="highlight">AI generated outputs</span> may weaken the habit of questioning
        information and forming original ideas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ultimately, the responsible use of artificial intelligence will define its impact
        on society. Maintaining a balance between <strong>human intelligence</strong> and
        digital assistance ensures that innovation strengthens rather than replaces
        critical thinking.
      </p>

      <p class="conclusion">
        <span class="highlight">
          In conclusion, the mindful application of AI requires balancing technical convenience
          with critical thinking. Responsible use ensures technology empowers human judgment
          rather than replacing it.
