    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      <q>AI will not replace us, it will amplify us</q>, according to
      <cite>Pedro Domingos</cite>. This highlights an ongoing debate about whether
      <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> enhances human capability or weakens
      <em>independent thought</em> in modern society.
    </p>

    <p>
      Artificial intelligence tools are now embedded in global industries such as
      <strong>healthcare</strong>, <strong>finance</strong>, and <strong>education</strong>.
      In the <em>Philippine setting</em>, AI is increasingly present in digital banking,
      online learning platforms, and automated customer service systems, reshaping
      how people approach decision making.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Technology becomes a problem when convenience replaces critical engagement.
    </blockquote>

    <h2 id="body">Body</h2>
    <p>
      The Filipino concept of <strong>diskarte</strong> represents creativity and adaptability
      developed through experience. When AI provides instant answers, overreliance may
      reduce judgment and analytical reasoning.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Critical thinking</em> develops through engagement with complex problems. AI can serve
      as a support tool for research and organization, but excessive dependence on
      <span class="highlight">AI generated outputs</span> may weaken the habit of questioning
      information and forming original ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ultimately, the responsible use of artificial intelligence will define its impact
      on society. Maintaining a balance between <strong>human intelligence</strong> and
      digital assistance ensures that innovation strengthens rather than replaces
      critical thinking.
    </p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="conclusion-box">
      In conclusion, the mindful application of AI requires balancing technical convenience
      with critical thinking. Responsible use ensures technology empowers human judgment
      rather than replacing it.
