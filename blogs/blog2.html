      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <blockquote>
        “It is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both.”<br>
        Niccolò Machiavelli
      </blockquote>
      <p class="dropcap">
        <span class="highlight">Ang kapangyarihan ay hindi laging tungkol sa pagiging mabait o popular.</span> Growing up, I never planned to be a leader. Leadership chose me. In school, in organizations, even in small groups of friends, I realized that people looked to me for direction, for decisions, for guidance.

      <h2>Body</h2>
      <p>
        This unexpected role brought tension. My personal belief in doing good and being ethical, inspired by Stoic teachings of Epictetus, often collided with the realities of power. <span class="highlight">The lessons of Stoicism and Machiavelli taught me that leadership requires both moral awareness and practical strategy.</span>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Democratic Leadership:</b> Collaboration and consensus-driven decision making.</li>
        <li><b>Authoritarian Leadership:</b> Quick, precise decisions in high-pressure situations.</li>
        <li><b>Supportive Leadership:</b> Guidance, motivation, and building confidence in teams.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In my experience, leadership requires balancing morality and strategy. Stoicism guided my ethical choices; Machiavelli taught practical navigation through real-world challenges.

          Ultimately, a true leader is measured not by followers, but by the courage to make difficult decisions and the wisdom to use power responsibly.
