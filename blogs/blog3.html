        <p class="dropcap">
            Have you ever wondered why some people naturally inspire others, even when others have more technical skill or experience? Soft skills are often overlooked in tech. Most people focus on hard skills. Para sa akin, leadership is about connection. <span class="highlight">The mediocre person with strong soft skills often has more leverage than the genius who doesn’t talk to anybody.</span>

            I’ve always been inspired by fictional leaders: 
            <strong>Aragorn</strong>, <strong>Optimus Prime</strong>, <strong>Batman</strong>. Leadership is about presence, influence, and understanding people.

          <li><b>Business Analyst:</b> Learning processes and stakeholders.</li>
          <li><b>Project Manager:</b> Coordinating projects and teams.</li>
          <li><b>Director:</b> Guiding strategy and mentoring emerging leaders.</li>
          <li><b>CEO / Startup Founder:</b> Building vision, taking calculated risks, and leading teams.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="conclusion">
            In conclusion, I seek leadership because it challenges and transforms. <strong>Technical skills open doors, but connection and soft skills sustain the journey.</strong>
