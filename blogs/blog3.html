    <p class="dropcap">
      Have you ever wondered why some people naturally inspire others, even when others have more technical skill or experience? Soft skills are often overlooked in tech. Most people focus on hard skills. Para sa akin, leadership is about connection.

    <h2>Body</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve always been inspired by fictional leaders: <strong>Aragorn</strong>, <strong>Optimus Prime</strong>, <strong>Batman</strong>. Leadership is not about authority alone—it’s about presence, influence, and understanding people.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Business Analyst:</b> Learning processes and stakeholders.</li>
      <li><b>Project Manager:</b> Coordinating projects and teams.</li>
      <li><b>Director:</b> Guiding strategy and mentoring emerging leaders.</li>
      <li><b>CEO / Startup Founder:</b> Building vision, taking calculated risks, and leading teams.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Soft skills, strategic thinking, and presence</strong> are my differentiators. I focus on <em>listening, observing, and connecting</em>. I want to sit with everybody, influence through respect, and guide teams toward impact. <em>Leadership is about heart and mind, not just authority.</em>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="conclusion-box">
      In conclusion, I seek leadership because it challenges and transforms. <strong>Technical skills open doors, but connection and soft skills sustain the journey.</strong> My vision: to learn, to lead, to build influence, and eventually guide teams and organizations with empathy, strategy, and purpose.
