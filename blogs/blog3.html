            <q>People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.</q> — <cite>Simon Sinek</cite>
        </p>

        <p class="dropcap">
            Have you ever wondered why some people naturally inspire others, even when others have more technical skill or experience? Soft skills are often overlooked in tech. Most people focus on hard skills. Para sa akin, leadership is about connection. Minsan, kahit gaano ka kagaling, walang mangyayari kung hindi ka marunong makipag-ugnayan. 
            <span class="highlight">The mediocre person with strong soft skills often has more leverage than the genius who doesn’t talk to anybody.</span>

        <p>
            I’ve always been inspired by fictional leaders: <strong>Aragorn</strong>, <strong>Optimus Prime</strong>, <strong>Batman</strong>. Leadership is not about authority alone—it’s about presence, influence, and understanding people.
        </p>

        <p>
            Books like <strong>Leaders Eat Last by Simon Sinek</strong>, <strong>Atomic Habits by James Clear</strong>, and <strong>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey</strong> taught me that habits, purpose, and people-first leadership build long-term impact. Kahit maliit na aksyon araw-araw, may epekto sa kabuuan ng team at organisasyon. 
            <span class="highlight">This illustrates the Kaizen principle—continuous improvement in small steps leads to massive change over time. Leadership is about the small, consistent actions that build trust and influence.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            The title <strong>The Man Who Sits with Everybody</strong> reflects my philosophy: a true leader does not isolate themselves at the top but sits among the team, listens, and understands. Leaders lead from the frontlines. They bear the risks, face the challenges, and in moments of crisis, leaders are the first to act, sometimes even sacrificing their own comfort or safety. That is where influence is born, when people see you standing with them, not above them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes, when someone enters a room, their gestures, posture, and attention show charisma immediately. Almost everyone wants to stay an individual contributor because leadership demands visibility, risk, and a different skill set. Pero gusto ko ang challenge. <strong>Gusto kong makita kung ano ang nasa likod ng bawat pinto, sa bawat silid ng desisyon, hindi lang mula sa taas.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            I also learned that rising to the C-suite is about connection. Your network, the people who like you, and how you influence them matter as much as technical skill. Para makarating sa tuktok, kailangan mo ng respeto at tiwala sa iba.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Business Analyst:</strong> Learning processes and stakeholders.</li>
            <li><strong>Project Manager:</strong> Coordinating projects and teams.</li>
            <li><strong>Director:</strong> Guiding strategy and mentoring emerging leaders.</li>
            <li><strong>CEO / Startup Founder:</strong> Building vision, taking calculated risks, and leading teams.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Even as I pursue leadership, I want to keep technical knowledge. Para maintindihan ko ang team ko at paano nila ginagawa ang trabaho. Leadership is about combining strategy, empathy, and understanding with technical insight.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Soft skills, strategic thinking, and presence</strong> are my differentiators. I focus on <em>listening, observing, and connecting</em>. I want to sit with everybody, influence through respect, and guide teams toward impact. <em>Leadership is about heart and mind, not just authority.</em>

            In conclusion, I seek leadership because it challenges and transforms. <strong>Technical skills open doors, but connection and soft skills sustain the journey.</strong> My vision: to learn, to lead, to build influence, and eventually guide teams and organizations with empathy, strategy, and purpose.
