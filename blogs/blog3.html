      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <blockquote>
        “People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.”<br>
        Simon Sinek

      <p class="dropcap">
        Have you ever wondered why some people naturally inspire others, even when others have more technical skill or experience? Soft skills are often overlooked in tech. Most people focus on hard skills. Para sa akin, leadership is about connection. Minsan, kahit gaano ka kagaling, walang mangyayari kung hindi ka marunong makipag-ugnayan.

      <h2>Body</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve always been inspired by fictional leaders: <strong>Aragorn</strong>, <strong>Optimus Prime</strong>, <strong>Batman</strong>. Leadership is about presence, influence, and understanding people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Books like <strong>Leaders Eat Last</strong>, <strong>Atomic Habits</strong>, and <strong>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</strong> taught me that habits, purpose, and people-first leadership build long-term impact.

          Soft skills, strategic thinking, and presence differentiate leaders. Leadership is about listening, observing, connecting, and guiding teams with empathy and purpose.
