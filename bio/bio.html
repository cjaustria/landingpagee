      <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
      <p class="dropcap">
        My childhood feels blurry now, but I clearly remember my family calling me by my name, Christian, as if I were the center of their little universe.<sup>1</sup>
        I was born in Cainta, Rizal in 2005, surrounded by a loving family who made me feel like the protagonist of a movie.<sup>2</sup>
        I dreamed of becoming a priest, an astronaut, a scientist like Newton, or even a hacker.<sup>3</sup>
        You would probably think I watched too many fictional movies, and honestly, you would be right.<sup>4</sup>
        I had friends, but I was shy and introverted, rarely approaching anyone unless invited.<sup>5</sup>
        I loved going to the <i>palengke</i> with my mother because I enjoyed hearing <i>tindera</i> and <i>tindero</i> calling me <i>pogi</i>, smelling the fresh fish, watching them move, seeing how someone would remove their organs, and exploring the colorful candies around the stalls.<sup>6</sup>
        One of my subtle favorite things was reading any word I could see, and whenever I was outside, I would stare at cars passing by as if staring into a void that somehow felt satisfying.<sup>7</sup>
        During rainy days, I was not allowed to play in the rain because I had a weak body, hence I spent many afternoons at my cousin's house watching <cite>Adventure Time</cite>, <cite>Regular Show</cite>, <cite>The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy</cite>, <cite>Thomas and Friends</cite>, and <cite>Frozen</cite>.<sup>8</sup>
        Sometimes I wish I could be a child again, and I would sacrifice everything just to feel that innocence once more.<sup>9</sup>
        One day at church, my friends and I had a surprisingly deep conversation inspired by the homily.<sup>10</sup>
        We related the message to ourselves, and I asked, <i>“Gusto mo na ba tumanda or bumalik sa pagkabata uli?”</i> even though we were still kids then.<sup>11</sup>
        Even as a child, I questioned everything like a mini-Socrates trying to understand life.<sup>12</sup>
        I was the smart one, but I did not go all out in school because I never saw the point in competing for grades when learning was never supposed to be a race.<sup>13</sup>
        I just wanted to study what I truly loved, not what was forced upon me.<sup>14</sup>
        Around 2011, I experienced my first genuine emotion from deep within.<sup>15</sup>
        I saw my siblings crying when we learned that our grandfather had died, and at first, I just stared.<sup>16</sup>
        Someone whispered to me, questioning why I did not cry, reminding me not to follow the taboo that men should not show emotion.<sup>17</sup>
        In that moment, I cried, understanding death, loss, and the truth that no one comes back once gone.<sup>18</sup>
        I also remember meeting Santa in person when he handed me a gift, and although I later realized it was just a costume, were we not all once children who believed he was real?<sup>19</sup>
        Whether Santa was real or not, the love, warmth, and compassion I felt in that moment stayed with me forever.<sup>20</sup>

    <section id="teenage">
      <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
      <p>
        During my teenage years, life shifted in ways I could not have anticipated, presenting obstacles, lessons, and deep self-reflection.<sup>1</sup>
        I often felt left behind, from not knowing how to clean myself after using the toilet, tie my own shoes, write in cursive, or take medicine, but I realized that our weaknesses build our strengths.<sup>2</sup>
        The practice of doing these things, even with fear, forged courage within me, and I reminded myself that it was only unfamiliarity, not incapability, with innocence meaning we did not know how, but over time, we figured things out like debugging a program.<sup>3</sup>
        In high school, I was the underdog smart, and often lazy, but when the situation called for it, I shone as the cleverest, earning the nickname <i>“lazy clever boy”</i>.<sup>4</sup>
        During investigatory projects, I was always assigned a leader by my teacher because she knew my potential, even if I was the laziest in the group.<sup>5</sup>
        We created the best investigatory project: malunggay oil and a natural Vicks inhaler without its chemical contents.<sup>6</sup>
        In those years, I was also a playboy, managing the attention of two girls, being a <i>two-timer</i>, which boosted my ego but taught me lessons about responsibility and love.<sup>7</sup>
        Impulsiveness and neglect caused me to lose my class rank, though I excelled in other strengths.<sup>8</sup>
        I realized life is not only about school ranking but about real-life application, earning the title <i>“siga na matalino”</i>.<sup>9</sup>
        I was also a bully, reflecting the bullying I experienced at home, yet I did not enjoy it.<sup>10</sup>
        Ironically, at home, I was a scaredy-cat, terrified of eerie sounds at night or after watching scary movies, a stark contrast to the <i>“siga na matalino”</i> persona I carried at school.<sup>11</sup>
        I had friends who encouraged rebellion, and I often felt like <cite>Will Hunting</cite> navigating life with intelligence and risk.<sup>12</sup>
        Life in high school went by like skipping frames in an editing software, and I barely cared about schoolwork or requirements.<sup>13</sup>
        I experienced my first heartbreak with a girl I thought I loved, a situationship in which she cheated with my best friend.<sup>14</sup>
        I realized I was accountable for myself, even though she worsened a part of my story.<sup>15</sup>
        The pandemic arrived, which worsened life but also brought families together.<sup>16</sup>
        I returned to my smart self and finished high school with <strong>Awards of Excellence</strong> without shortcuts.<sup>17</sup>
        Senior high school went by like lightning, and I met a girl who became my first true love, my best friend since Kindergarten 2, my rose in a whole garden of roses, perfectly imperfect, where love, time, and proximity made her unique, and I considered her my true love.<sup>18</sup>
        When I met her, I felt like <cite>The Little Prince</cite> in <cite>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s</cite> novella, discovering a flower that belonged only to me.<sup>19</sup>
        We graduated with <strong>Awards of Excellence</strong> together, thanks to shared hard work.<sup>20</sup>

      <h2>College Years</h2>
      <p>
        Starting college felt like stepping into a new rhythm of life, where each day brought tests, discoveries, and small victories, a place where I constantly strive for good grades, feeling like a rat running endlessly on a wheel.<sup>1</sup>
        I promised myself that once I truly understood who I was, I would break free from the cycle and create the life I desired, because I know I am capable.<sup>2</sup>
        I am a 2nd year <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</strong> student at the <strong>University of the East, Manila</strong>, under the College of Computer Studies and Systems Department, and a <strong>Tan Yan Kee scholar</strong>.<sup>3</sup>
        Life as an adult has shown me that time moves fast, responsibilities increase, and happiness is not guaranteed.<sup>4</sup>
        I became cold and emotionless at times, realizing that adulthood can be heavy and unforgiving.<sup>5</sup>
        College life became emotionally centered on my breakup and endless sleepless nights, testing both my resolve and patience, and I became a perfectionist, chasing excellence to shield myself from failure.<sup>6</sup>
        I stumbled in my first year, learning that mistakes are part of growth.<sup>7</sup>
        <cite>Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations</cite> inspired me to practice <i>Stoicism</i>, reminding me to embrace <i>amor fati</i> — to love my fate — and accept life as it comes.<sup>8</sup>
        I also meditate on <i>memento mori</i>, remembering that life is finite and each moment must be lived fully.<sup>9</sup>
        I learned to control what I can, remain calm under pressure, and not let external events dictate my emotions.<sup>10</sup>
        I developed my own methods to survive college life, focusing on personal growth over comparison with others.<sup>11</sup>
        I realized that discomfort and challenges are opportunities to strengthen character.<sup>12</sup>
        I discovered that small victories over fear and procrastination are just as important as high grades.<sup>13</sup>
        College taught me to embrace responsibility, discipline, and patience as virtues.<sup>14</sup>
        Even with overwhelming tasks, I remind myself that endurance builds resilience.<sup>15</sup>
        I see opportunities for growth in every setback, understanding that fate shapes us and our responses matter more than events themselves.<sup>16</sup>
        I cherish fleeting joys, like laughter with friends or quiet reflection at night.<sup>17</sup>
        Each day is a lesson in <i>Stoicism</i>, self-reliance, and perseverance.<sup>18</sup>
        Despite the hardships, I believe that I am forming a strong foundation for my future.<sup>19</sup>
        I conclude with the words of <cite>Marcus Aurelius</cite>: <i>“The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.”</i><sup>20</sup>
